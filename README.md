# The Games

## For people whol like to read code

Start with the ``pics`` branch, try to find a way to the
``you-won`` tag.

The trick is, there will be a point where you'll have to write some code to win.

Good luck!

## For people who like security

The answer is a string:

* Size: 21
* It contains a few letters and a few numbers, plus a few other printable characters (all ASCII, no Unicode)
* I will never be able to remember it, but if I have acces to Internet I can check if you've managed to find it
* It can be brute-forced by any programmer

Some clues:
* I will *never* use it as a password, but maybe for auth (maybe)
* There's a clue on this page, but not in this paragraph

Good luck, and if you find it, please don't spoil it here.
